***Project***

> This project aims to design and implement a system for tracking attendance using facial recognition or biometric technology in educational and corporate settings. The project will begin by reviewing current attendance tracking systems and analyzing various facial recognition and biometric technologies. Based on this analysis, a suitable technology will be chosen and a prototype system will be developed. The project will also consider the ethical and privacy implications of using such technology and develop strategies to mitigate any potential risks. The end result will be a functional system for tracking attendance and a report detailing the technical, ethical, and privacy considerations involved. This system will provide a reliable and efficient solution for tracking attendance in educational and corporate settings while addressing ethical and privacy concerns.


***Problem***

> There is a need for a reliable and efficient system for tracking attendance in educational and corporate settings. Currently, many schools and companies rely on manual attendance tracking methods, such as sign-in sheets or ID card swipes, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. There is also a growing concern about the ethical and privacy implications of using such methods, particularly in light of the increasing availability of facial recognition and biometric technology. As a result, there is a need for a solution that combines the reliability and efficiency of attendance tracking with the ethical and privacy considerations of using such technology.

***Achievements***

During the Open Life Science program, the main achievements we hope to accomplish for the "Implementing Facial Recognition and Biometric Attendance Monitoring in Educational and Corporate Settings" project are as follows:

* Review current attendance tracking systems and technologies: We will conduct a review of the various attendance tracking systems and technologies currently in use, including their accuracy and reliability. This will provide a baseline for evaluating the potential of facial recognition and biometric technology as a solution.

* Analyze facial recognition and biometric technologies: We will evaluate the various facial recognition and biometric technologies available on the market, including their strengths and limitations. This will help us to select the most suitable technology for the project.

* Design and implement a prototype system: Based on the technology selected, we will design and implement a prototype system for tracking attendance using facial recognition or biometric technology. This will involve integrating the technology into the existing attendance tracking system and testing its accuracy and reliability.

*  Consider ethical and privacy implications: We will research and evaluate the potential risks and benefits of using facial recognition or biometric technology for attendance tracking, and develop strategies to mitigate any potential risks.

***Open***

There are several reasons why i am  inspired to work openly in research:

* Sharing knowledge: Researchers often work on projects to advance their fields of study and contribute to the broader body of knowledge. By working openly, researchers can share their findings and results with a wider audience, enabling others to build upon their work and further advance the field.

* Collaboration: Open research practices facilitate collaboration and allow researchers to work with others in a transparent and accountable manner. This can lead to more productive and efficient research, as well as more diverse and innovative approaches to solving problems.

* Impact: Working openly can increase the impact of research by making it more accessible and visible to others. This can lead to greater recognition for the researchers and their work, as well as more opportunities for collaboration and funding.

* Ethical considerations: Open research practices can also help to ensure that research is conducted ethically and transparently. This can include things like sharing data and methods to enable others to replicate and verify results, as well as being open to feedback and criticism from the research community.

In conclusion, working openly in research can lead to greater impact and collaboration, as well as more ethical and transparent practices, which are all important considerations for researchers.

***Challenges***

There are several challenges that i or any researcher  may face while working in open science:

* Funding: Many researchers rely on grant funding to support their work, and traditional grant funding models may not always support open science practices. This can make it difficult for researchers to justify the time and resources needed to make their work openly available.

* Data sharing: Sharing data can be time-consuming and may require additional resources, such as data management and curation. Researchers may also be concerned about the security and privacy of their data, and may need to put in place measures to protect sensitive information.

* Intellectual property: Researchers may be hesitant to share their work openly for fear of losing control over their intellectual property. This can be particularly challenging in cases where researchers are working on proprietary or commercial projects.

* Lack of infrastructure: There may be a lack of infrastructure and support for open science practices within some research organizations, which can make it difficult for researchers to implement open science practices in their work.

* Culture change: Adopting open science practices can require a shift in the culture and mindset of researchers and the research community. This can be a challenging process and may require education and support to ensure that open science practices are embraced and integrated into the research process.

Overall, while open science has the potential to drive innovation and impact, it also presents a number of challenges for researchers.

***Learning***

As a participant in the OLS program, my learning goals are :

* To gain a deeper understanding of open science practices and how they can be applied in research: Through the program, I hope to learn more about the principles and benefits of open science, as well as the various tools and approaches that can be used to support open research practices.

* To develop skills in data management and sharing: One of the key aspects of open science is the sharing of data and other research outputs. I hope to gain expertise in best practices for data management and sharing, including techniques for organizing, storing, and disseminating data in an open and transparent manner.

* To build a network of like-minded researchers: Through the OLS program, I hope to connect with other researchers who are interested in open science and build a network of peers and mentors who can support my work and help me to develop as a researcher.

Overall, my learning goals in the OLS program are focused on developing my skills and understanding in open science practices, as well as building a network of like-minded researchers who can support and collaborate with me in my work.

***Mentor***

As a participant in the Open Life Science program, some potential expectations from  a mentor  include:

* Providing guidance and expertise: A mentor can provide guidance and support to help me and  the team navigate the various challenges and obstacles that may arise during the project. he can also provide expertise and insights based on his own experience in the field.

* Offering constructive feedback: A mentor can provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement to help the team progress and achieve the goals. This could include feedback on the project plan, technical approaches, and communication strategies.

* Facilitating connections and introductions: he  can help to facilitate connections and introductions to other researchers, experts, or organizations that may be able to provide valuable resources or support for the project.

* Encouraging open science practices: As a mentor in the Open Life Science program, it would be expected that he would support and encourage the team to adopt open science practices, such as sharing data and making the work openly available.

Overall, he will  play a valuable role in supporting the team and helping us to achieve the goals for the project.
