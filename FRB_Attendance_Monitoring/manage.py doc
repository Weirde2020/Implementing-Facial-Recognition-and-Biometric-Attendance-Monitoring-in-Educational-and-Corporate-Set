The code provided in the manage.py file is the main entry point for running Django administrative tasks using the Django management command-line utility.
Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. Shebang (!/usr/bin/env python): This line is known as a "shebang" or "hashbang" and is used in Unix-like operating systems to specify the interpreter 
that should be used to execute the script. In this case, it specifies that the Python interpreter should be used to run the script.

2. Docstring ("""Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks."""): This is a docstring, which is a multi-line string that serves as documentation 
for the script. It provides a brief description of the script's purpose.

3. Import statements: The script imports various modules and functions necessary for its operation.

import os: imports the os module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including setting environment variables.

import sys: imports the sys module, which provides access to variables used or maintained by the interpreter and functions that interact with the Python runtime environment.

4. `main()` function: This function is defined to be the entry point for running administrative tasks. It sets the Django settings module and then attempts to import and execute
Django's management command-line utility

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'FRB_Attendance_Monitoring.settings'): This line sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to specify which Django settings
module should be used. In this case, it's set to 'FRB_Attendance_Monitoring.settings'.

try block: This block contains the main logic of the script. It attempts to import execute_from_command_line from django.core.management. If Django is not installed or cannot be imported,
It raises an import error and provides a helpful error message.

5. if __name__ == '__main__': block: This block ensures that the main() function is only called if the script is executed directly, rather than when it's imported as a module into another script.

main(): If the script is executed directly (not imported), it calls the main() function, which sets up the Django environment and executes administrative tasks based on the command-line arguments provided.
